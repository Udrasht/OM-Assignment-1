# Optimization Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various optimization algorithms, including steepest descent and Newton's method, applied to different objective functions. The code provides functionalities to visualize the convergence behavior and contour plots of the objective functions.

## Function Implementations

The following objective functions are implemented in the `functions.py` file:

- Trid function
- Three-hump camel function
- Rosenbrock function
- Styblinski-Tang function
- Func_1

## Requirements

To run this code, you need:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- Required Python packages: **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **prettytable**.

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execute the main script to run the optimization algorithms:
``` python main.py ```


After running the script, you can find the generated plots in the plots folder.

For a detailed explanation of the implemented functions and algorithms, refer to the report.pdf file.
## Plot Folder
The plots folder contains all the generated graphs during the execution of the optimization algorithms. These graphs depict the convergence behavior and contour plots of the objective functions.

## Report
For a detailed explanation of the implemented functions and algorithms, including mathematical formulations, algorithmic details, and performance analysis, refer to the report.pdf file.

Feel free to adjust the parameters and test cases in the main.py file to explore different optimization scenarios.

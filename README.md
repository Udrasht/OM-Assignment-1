# Optimization Algorithms

## Introduction

This repository contains Python implementations of optimization algorithms such as steepest descent and Newton's method. These algorithms are commonly used to find the minimum of a given objective function. The code is organized into separate files for functions, algorithms, and plotting utilities.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- Required Python packages: **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **prettytable**.

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
